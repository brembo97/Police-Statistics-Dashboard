# Police Statistics Dashboard

## Description
The police statistics are data sets published yearly by the Judiciary System of Costa Rica
containing the frequency of crimes throughout the country and its geographical 
divisions, details of the victims, and details of the crimes committed. The objective
of the dashboard is to create a convenient and robust tool that is able to detect
and display any meaningful trends or insights found in the data. This will hopefully
lead to actionable information for the local and federal governments to take informed
decisions concerning resource distribution, gender disparities, crime proliferation or any
crime related topics.
